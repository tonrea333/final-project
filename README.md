Chess

This program was created to demonstrate a level of coding proficency as related to term one of Code Immersives.  The student was tasked with choosing a project that 
would provide at least a weeks worth of coding, troubleshooting, and research at respective coding level.  A number of specified/partially-specified requirement were also included: "Your app has at least three distinct "features"; Your project has at least ten commits in git; Your app is mobile responsive; Your project contains a `README.md` file that explains what your project is and how to use it; Your project is hosted on GitHub pages; Your code is clean; Proper indentation; No unnecessary repetition; Variables as camelCase." (Final Project)

# Final Project

In this project, you'll build a web application that does anything you want! 

It must meet the project requirements below, but beyond that, feel free to use your creativity to decide on what your app will do.

## Requirements

* **Your app has at least three distinct "features"**
  * If you are building a travel planning application, one feature could be allowing users to create a new trip
* Your project has at least ten commits in git
* Your app is mobile responsive
* Your project contains a `README.md` file that explains what your project is and how to use it
* Your project is hosted on GitHub pages
* Your code is clean
  * Proper indentation
  * No unnecessary repetition
  * Variables as camelCase

## Project ideas

* Travel planner
* Budget manager
* Resume builder
* Shift scheduling app
* Chat bot
* Music making app
* Games
  * PacMan
  * Chess
* Do something with an external API: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
  * Slack / discord bot
  * Recreate Reddit
  * Pokedex

And so many more possibilities!

## Recommendations

* Start out by creating your project's foundation in HTML.
* Frequently make commmits in git to save your progress.
* Build one piece of Javascript functionality at a time, testing each change you make with `console.log`. 
* Keep your code meticulously organized as you go. 
* Use proper indentation, whitespace, and comments. 
* Try to write a function for each separate piece of functionality that exists in your code. This will make your code "modular" and easier to build off of.
* If you find yourself repeating code, think about how you could use either a loop or a new function to eliminate the repitition.
